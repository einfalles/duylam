# Please Revise Portfolio

Hello, person. The only person that would be reading this is Duylam.
If you're some internet stranger, welcome. I (Duylam) have decided to move my
portfolio on to Github pages because 1) Tumblr is a bit rigid as a CMS 2) privacy
and ownership has become more important to me 3) your CMS and your social media
platform don't have to be one and 4) I hope to encourage more designers to learn
to program by making this available.
