# Please Revise Portfolio

Hello, person. The only person that would be reading this is Duylam.
If you're some internet stranger, welcome. I (Duylam) have decided to move my
portfolio on to Github pages because 1) Tumblr is a bit rigid as a CMS 2) privacy
and ownership has become more important to me 3) your CMS and your social media
platform don't have to be one and 4) I hope to encourage more designers to learn
to program by making this available.

# Todo
- [x] Pull images from Tumblr and store in assets
- [ ] Templatize case studies
- [ ] Create custom scrollbar
- [x] Order the pages by date in array

- [ ] Remove some projects from portfolio section
- [x] Create endpoints for About, Daily Dispatch, and Tags
- [] QA on various browsers
- [ ] Add CNAME file to enable GitHub Pages custom domain
