          <p>There are countless companies that are designing their technology to maximize time-on-site. The consequences can be seen at everywhere. These apps attempt to deaden our brains long enough to whittle at our autonomy.</p>

          <p>Part of the antidote is Siempo, a smartphone focused on mindfulness and simplicity. Along with Hilah Shenhav (designer), Stephanie Shorter (neuroscientist), and Matthew Sutherland (motion designer), I asked “What does a distractionless operating
            system look like?”.</p>

          <p>The largest challenge here was adhering to the principle of intentionality. In practice, this meant creating the navigation of each feature so the user could enter the feature, perform the key task, and exit as quickly as possible. I eventually
            figured out that the interface elements had to be massive, the settings and other tasks obscured by one or more levels, and exiting was never more than 2 clicks away.</p>

          <p>Future iterations of Siempo will rely heavily on the home screen. Here, you will be able to access everything on your phone and there are plans of using NLP/NLU to power a conversational interface that would allow access to an array of services
            while keeping in line with Siempo’s simplicity.</p>
