Text message notifications are particularly annoying because they come in with zero regard to how busy you are. Even now, context-aware notifications are difficult to create because they require multimodal data sources. After a failed Y Combinator interview, Ashutosh and I retooled and reimagined the notification experience. Molly is an app that intelligently answers questions about your location, schedule, and delivers your messages when youâ€™re free. This helped us manage our distractions, but let us communicate with each other about meetings.
