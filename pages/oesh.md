During my fourth year at the University of Virginia (UVA), I helped OESH Shoes, a local company started by a UVA professor, manufacture an orthopaedic sandal. Doctor Kerrigan studied human motions for over twenty years and needed help with the mechanical design aspect of staring a shoe company. While most shoes focus on style, they increase peak joint torques that are related to stresses and strains in muscles and joints. With four other classmates, we collaboratively designed the injection cold used to produce the soles of the sandals.
