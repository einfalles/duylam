After leaving Monkey Inferno and Jiffy, I joined Sunsama in early 2015. I was sold on the belief that we would be helping humans connect and have meaningful relationships. During my time, I helped shape the product with Travis Meyer, and led the visual design. Sunsama started out as “a social network for time” and became the calendar for teams. We learned that teams had trouble coordinating schedules and collaborating on meetings. Sunsama is now being used at startups and agencies like Huge, Weebly, and Unilever.
