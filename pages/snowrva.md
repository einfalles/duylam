Holidays can bring people together. There is a warmth to that period of the year. Sandrine, my collaborator, and I asked ourselves - “How can we bring holiday cheer to Richmond?” Our answer was an interactive installation. It blasted cheerful tunes and made a personal snowstorm when you made a snow angel shape in front of our window display. Our system comprised of a Xbox Kinect, two snow machines, two Arduinos, four radio modules, a boombox, and Orange, a local retailer that let us set up our installation. At least, 100 selfies were taken that day.
