I spent most of 2016 travelling throughout Southeast Asia. During my travels, data would be limited or social media would be blocked. This made it hard to give my own mom peace of mind. Mother is Siri for your friends and family. Mother connects with various APIs (Four Square, Twitter, Misfit Shine, etc) and creates a digital approximation of you. This allows you to communicate important information with your friends even when you’re not available - whether you’re on travel, in a meeting, or taking a nap.
