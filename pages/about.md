# What's the deal?
### â€“
Big news.
There is a shit ton of things happening right now. You already know. My focus is to make the internet not terrible. It is really bad right now. But there are some ground rules for how I will operate moving forward. First, I am limiting the number of projects that I am allowing to run at the same time. This means my attention gets denser. Second, I am prioritizing the projects, in terms of urgency. Some things are necessary now (MJU) and some things can be in a crockpot (SHOSHANNA). Anyway, this is just a brain dump for me to see how nice it can be to write pages using Markdown. You can contact me at dlamnguyen(at)gmail(dot)com
