I conceived of Nozzle after visiting Da Lat, Viet Nam. The night market there would have a pop up arcade. Kids would pay about a dollar to play games like Flappy Birds on iPhones and Samsungs mounted to poles. Nozzle puts an arcade in your phone. We deliver you a fresh, new game every week and remove the ones from the week before. Currently, Sandrine Ngo and I are designing and developing 8 HTML5 games to release on Nozzle when it launches.
