The University of Virginia noticed a spike in campus crimes between 2011 ad 2012. The kidnapping and murder of Morgan Harrington was still fresh in the collective mind there were many events to raise awareness about safety. Ashutosh and I developed a fix, which would go on to take first place at states and nation startup competitions like SXSW. WalkBack was a safety social network to help students keep each other safe. WalkBack improves personal safety by changing user behavior in a way familiar to college students - on the phone.
