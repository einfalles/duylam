Friends can be flaky. So how can we make it easy to meet up? Before you could share locations in iMessage, you had to text to coordinate locations and time. For me, that meant sending 10+ texts back and forth. With Reachd, you meet up by picking a place, inviting a group of friends, set travel mode, and set a leave time. Your friends can see your location and get an estimate on when you’ll be arriving. Now you don’t need ten texts. Instead, you’re pushed to be radically honest about hanging out.
