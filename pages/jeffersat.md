During my undergraduate studies, I helped develop a cube satellite powered by an Android phone. I was part of the communications team. We wrote the software necessary to capture phone sensor data, transmit data and phones via the Iridium Satellite Constellation, and control various systems on the cube sat. One of the unique challenges we faced was figuring out how to buffer, compress, and send the data in between the movement of the Iridium Satellites. We successfully launched the cube satellite and won a bid to land on a NASA payload.
