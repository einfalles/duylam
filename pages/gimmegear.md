I designed and conceived GimmeGear with Matt Sutherland, Adam Russell, and Cade Scroggins, during an event. To buy professional film gear you have to: research gear, price shop, quality control, and if you're on craigslist, haggle with the seller. Typically, this process occurs across dozens of sites. GimmeGear automates this entire process with minimal human supervision. Create your gear wish list. Get pinged when your gear is found. Buy it. Now, you can get back to shooting.
