This is the first commercial product I ever designed. The idea is simple; it’s just a stirrer made from the bad that holds the tea. The idea came when I was in my kitchen brewing tea and stirring with a chopstick. I wrote about the idea in my admission essay for Babson College. Maybe it’s why I got in.

I tried to formally manufacture this product and leaned a lot in the process. This project taught me about design for manufacturing, industrial design, packaging, sourcing materials, lifecycle analysis, the number of Lipton Tea farms, and so much more. Ultimately, I gave up on materializing the teastick beyond a prototype because of the financial cost, legal regulations, and marketing. However, I did become obsess with making things afterwards.
