I used to live on the fourth floor of an apartment complex during university. Have you thrown a party that high up? All you’re doing is sprinting up and down to let people in. And that’s part of the appeal of “smart” homes. There are tiny inconveniences everywhere to solve. Easier sous vide? Perfect pork loin roast? Letting in the Amazon driver to drop off a package? Latch helps solve the last problem.

The company creates a bluetooth enabled mortise lock and complementary software. This allows for the simple management of access and keys. The team compelled me to the company. That’s not to say the vision wasn’t grand and attractive. The door is the first touchpoint for a home, and if we could make an intelligent solution there, then we could make more home products smarter. My contribution to the team was in industrial and visual design, peppered with comments on how we should leverage A.I. as the brain of the lock.

I designed the earliest versions of the lock, but with manufacturing many months out, I transitioned to visual design (interfaces and brand). The company recently soft launched its locks. My time there helped Latch secure the funding, from firms like R/GA and TechStars, necessary to do the pilot. While I’m not an employee, I still believe in the vision and try to help Luke and the team i small ways like connecting them to Thomas Meyerhoff, the current chief design officer.
